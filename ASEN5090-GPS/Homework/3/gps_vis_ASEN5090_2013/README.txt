* The driver program is called GPSvisibility_GUI
	- This will run the GUI (graphical user interface) that
          allows you to enter in the scenario settings and run
          the visibility computations.

* Most of the files are .p files instead of the usual .m files.
	- This simply indicates that these files are encrypted
          using MATLAB's encryption algorithm.  You can still
          use them, you just can't open them.

* broadcast2xva is given as a .p and as a .m file
	- The .p file is the actual encrypted code
	- The .m file contains the header information for the
          function so that you know how to call broadcast2xva
          in your own routine if you wish.  You can open the
          .m file or type >> help broadcast2xva to view the
          header information.
