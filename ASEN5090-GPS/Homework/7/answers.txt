1. The main difference between single frequency prefits for joze and onsa is that
while onsa's prefits look mainly randomly distributed, joze has a very obvious
trend. Joze's residules have sharp and steady climbs in prefits in time, and 
then the prefit drops back to its previous low, in a manner that looks very much
like a triangle wave. Each satellite's residule is stacked at almost the same 
place in time. This is likely due to the fact that the joze clock is much lower
quality than the onsa one. The triangle wave error form is caused by the clock
drifting, then being reset. It is clearly the dominant factor in joze's 
residule values. 

2. The single frequency prefit residules are different from the ionosphere
free ones because the ionosphere affects each satellite differently, as they are
in different positions in their orbits. The single frequency prefit contains
structure for each PRN plotted, while the ion-free residules have a more normal
distribution. 

3. The 4-5 sigma outliers in onsa's ion-free residules are due to low elevation
data points. See the plot of residules vs elevation. The residules grow much
more dispersed for low elevation observations. A good mitigation strategy could
be to raise the elevation mask, so that only higher, more trustworthy observations
would be included.
